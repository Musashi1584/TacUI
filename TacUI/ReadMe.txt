[h1]Loadout UI Replacement[/h1]

A new loadout UI optimized for large lists featuring sorting and filters.

Made this primarily for RPGO and/or Resistance Firearms which make it horrible to work with the vanilla loadout ui list.

Filter and Sorting are saved per soldier and slot. You can clear them with the "RESET FILTER" button.

The video showcase was made with the "[WotC] UI - Colored Weapon Tiers" mod enabled.

Sorry no controller support yet.

Compatibility:
This mod overides UIArmory_Loadout and will be incompatible with any mods the do the same.
Use the alternate mod launcher to detect possible conflicts.
